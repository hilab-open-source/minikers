# MiniKers: Interaction-Powered Smart Environment Automation

### About
MiniKers is an fleet of interaction-powered environment automation devices that harnesses energy from user interactions, achieving self-sustaining automatic operations that could last for long periods of time without human intervention (e.g., exchanging batteries). MiniKers system opens opportunities for turning user interactions into power sources for research in ubiquitous computing, IoT, and cyber-physical systems.
